My third file


The eagle, barely feathered with down,
Barely felt the audacity of forces in itself,
He cut through the ether, soared with a flourish;
A chorus of birds, amazed by his appearance.
He sends a non-controversial shout to meet him.
No! The audacity of those eyes and that flight
He sees neither equals nor disobedient
, And he rules in the villages of the air,
Not so between people: ah! from the shrouds
The zealot of glory has been languishing for so many years!
He is still languishing mature,
Rejected and not recognized, oppressed…
Fate! Oh, how firm are your statutes!
Great in the midst of Australia's swells,
Or in the snow of the North, is it the same everywhere
Awarded! — To seek the desired share
Through enmity, obstacles and sorrows!
And the singer who no one dares to
Following the footsteps of the bards of these times.
Before whom does Holy Russia reverence,
He is a boy, unknown and despicable,
The son of a fisherman,
catches amphibian monsters, lived in the depths of the ice,
The soul of hungry countries and other affairs,
Exhausted in fruitless efforts!…
